# Road-Accident-Analysis
Conducted an in-depth analysis of road accident data to identify high-risk areas, causes, and trends.

* Tool Used: Microsoft PowerBI
* Data was taken from Kaggle
* Analyzed key metrics such as accident frequency, severity, time of occurrence, and contributing factors (e.g., weather conditions, road type, driver behavior)
* Utilized Power BI to create interactive dashboards that visualized accident hotspots, time-series trends, and demographic profiles of those involved in accidents
* The dashboards enabled users to filter data by location, accident type, and other relevant factors, providing a comprehensive view of road safety issues
